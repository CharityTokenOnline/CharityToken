# CharityToken
For donations to charities and relief services.

Charity Token can help the lives of people in need every day. Even with the smallest donation to any cause you can impact a community. Giving to a charity not only helps make your community a better place to live, but by helping to provide goods and services to those who may not have access to them gives you added purpose.

Executive Summary

Product Description/Objective
Most people would say that charity is always good, but not everyone. Some argue that charity is sometimes carried out badly, or less well than it should be, while others think that charity can bring bad results even when it is well implemented. Charity often helps the recipient with their problem, but it doesn't do much to deal with the causes of that problem. Our mission is to target the causes, not symptoms, in order to become a substitute for real justice.



Target Audience
Charity token is designed for any known non-profit entities and disaster relief.

Conclusions
What charities do with their funds? Charities may not make best use of their funds. The issue here is whether the charity we give to devotes a high enough proportion of its funds to the needy. Responsible charities make it very clear what proportion of contributions is spent on administration and fund-raising. Charities are often accountable to the givers not the receivers. If the purpose of charity is to benefit the recipients, it seems obvious that those best able to say whether they are achieving this end are the recipients. But because the recipients of charity are often unorganized and the charity doesn't know their individual identities, it's often easier for charities to make their performance reports to the givers. Charity Token is a necessary way to send funds with full transparency in order to promote ethical fundraising.
